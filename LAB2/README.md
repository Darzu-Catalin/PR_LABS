# Lab 2: HTTP File Server (Baseline)

This lab starts from the Lab 1 server/client functionality. The code, Docker setup, and quick-start scripts are copied as a baseline.

- src/: server and client code (copied from Lab 1)
- content/: empty for now (add your own test files)
- downloads/: empty (client saves here)
- screenshots/: empty (place screenshots for report)

## Getting Started

- Native: `./run.sh server`
- Docker: `docker-compose up --build`

Content is intentionally empty; add files to `content/` before testing.
